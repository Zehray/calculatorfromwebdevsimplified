/*1- The first thing that we need to think about is 
   how are we going to store all the information 
   for what's number currently typed here what number is currently typed here
   what operation is it and I think easiest way to do that is to use a class.
   so we're going to create a calculator class .

   Let's go in here and create a class which is called a calculator and inside of this class
   we're going to put a constructor which is going to take all the inputs 
   for it as well as all the functions for our calculator.
   */

   /*
   so, our constructor is essentially just going to take our previous operand text element and
   our current text element and this is because 
   we need to know where to place our display text for our calculator.

2-
next we want to think about all the operations our calculator class can come perform.

3-let's we think about the different properties our calculator needs to store.
* 3-1- We need to know the previous operand the user entered the current operand 
that they're working on and the operation that they've if any.

* 3-2-  inside the clear function all we need to do is 
remove all of these values the first thing we can do to just this.currentOperand = ''
we just want to default this to an empty string if they cleared, 
we want to do the same thing for thiss.previousOperand = ''
